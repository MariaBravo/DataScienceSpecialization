Since we are doing the analysis, we can specify how we define a motor vehicle, since there's no well established standard.
In my study I have chosen to define motor vehicles as ON-ROAD for simplicity.


There is another way, from this old posting:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2003-May/026485.html
"R will penalize the scientific notation version by 3 characters, and will print
"100000" in this example because 5+3 >= 6.  ("scipen" = "scientific notation
penalty".)  Setting e.g. options(scipen=999) will prevent effectively all
scientific notation."

So compare 

plot(10^(1:6), 10^(1:6))


vs

options(scipen=999)
plot(10^(1:6), 10^(1:6))
