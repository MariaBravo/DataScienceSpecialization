    The explanation is as important as the script, so make sure you have the readme
    have you combined the training and test x and y into one block, given them headings, and turned the numeric activities into something easier to read.
    have you extracted some variables to do with mean and standard deviation from the full set
    have you explained what those variables are and your criteria for picking them in the readme
    have you gotten the average of each variable for each combination of subject and activity and saved the data frame of this as a set of tidy data
    have you loaded up your current script, an up to date readme! and your tidy data


"for the purposes of this analysis, the variables were defined as.

When I did the assignment, I cleaned up the variable names.
I explained in my readme that since they were all the average of the values I had not included that aspect in the variable names. Either way works, huts make it clear what you have done.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.


If you are wanting to know the way most people shaped their output, it was column for subject, a column for activity, and columns for each summary variable (so 6*30 as each row represents a unique combination of subject and activity)


you should state your assumptions.
1) We assume that the files are in a Zip format at url xxxxx and proceed to download and extract to a convenient local directory.
2) We assume that files have been downloard and extracted to a local directory.


g <- split(UCIDATA[,5:565], list(UCIDATA$Activity, UCIDATA$Subject))
Splitdata <- sapply(g, colMeans)

The tidy data file goes to coursera. The code for creating it goes to GitHub.
